            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="button-gap">
                Isaac Newton (1642–1727) is best known for having invented the calculus in the mid to late 1660s (most
                of a decade before Leibniz did so independently, and ultimately more influentially) and for having
                formulated the theory of universal gravity — the latter in his Principia, the single most important work
                in the transformation of early modern natural philosophy into modern physical science. Yet he also made
                major discoveries in optics beginning in the mid-1660s and reaching across four decades; and during the
                course of his 60 years of intense intellectual activity he put no less effort into chemical and
                alchemical research and into theology and biblical studies than he put into mathematics and physics. He
                became a dominant figure in Britain almost immediately following publication of his Principia in 1687,
                with the consequence that “Newtonianism” of one form or another had become firmly rooted there within
                the first decade of the eighteenth century. His influence on the continent, however, was delayed by the
                strong opposition to his theory of gravity expressed by such leading figures as Christiaan Huygens and
                Leibniz, both of whom saw the theory as invoking an occult power of action at a distance in the absence
                of Newton's having proposed a contact mechanism by means of which forces of gravity could act. As the
                promise of the theory of gravity became increasingly substantiated, starting in the late 1730s but
                especially during the 1740s and 1750s, Newton became an equally dominant figure on the continent, and
                “Newtonianism,” though perhaps in more guarded forms, flourished there as well. What physics textbooks
                now refer to as “Newtonian mechanics” and “Newtonian science” consists mostly of results achieved on the
                continent between 1740 and 1800.

        <h1>My Recipies</h1>
        <p>
            5 killer dinner recipes, each of which can be explained in a paragraph: Do you believe us? You should,
            because just like you we constantly want a solution to motivating ourselves to make dinner after a long day
            of work. Especially when we come home, open our fridge, and find baking soda, a dried knob of ginger and
            half a bottle of white wine: Not even a Top Chef could pull something together from that.

            Honestly, most weekdays we don’t have the time for serious meal prep and sifting through cookbooks, even
            though we love to do that on weekends. Read below for five quick and easy weeknight recipes that each can be
            explained in one paragraph…
